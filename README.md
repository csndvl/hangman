## Description of the project
  - This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.
  - The project's goal was to implement knowledge from previous Python lessons to create a hangman program.
  - Main thing I learnt from this project was to use of classes in Python.

## Usage instruction
- Run the milestone5.py file.
- Enter a letter to make a guess.
- You start with 5 lives.
- You lose the game once your lives hit 0.
- You win the game once all letters have been correctly guessed.

## Installation instructions
- Clone the file from github and install python 3.10.7

## File structure of the project
- Milestone 2: Requires basic Python knowledge, such as if-else statements and loops.
- Milestone 3: Checks if the guesses letter is in the randomly chosen word.
- Milestone 4: Use Object Oriented Programming paradigm to develop a complete Hangman game.
- Milestone 5: The complete Hangman Game
